# Goals
* it contains a set of extensions for three.js
* to avoid repeating the same code over and over... while keeping three.js core small and lean
* the extension should stay small and dont depends from each other if possible
  * aka do a bunch of small plugins, not a monsterous monolitic lib on top of three.js

# TODO
* folder hierachie not yet known
* should i convert existing lib into this format ?
  * con: it is redundant and will be hard to maintain
  * con: the author of the other lib may not like it as it may be seen as dilluting the effort
  * pro: all libraries would have the same struct...
  * result: dubious avantages, numerous issue and the time to maintain
    * decision: no, use your time on more clearly usefull
  

## possible topic
* some may already exist of not
* window resize is here
* various textures generation
  * from pacexp
*
